# Foodie-Hub-Platform

## Overview

This project, "Foodie-Hub-Platform," is an early web application designed to serve as a community-driven directory for restaurants. Users can contribute by adding their own restaurants and menus, provide feedback through comments, and discover new places to eat by searching based on location and food type.

## Project Snapshot (Legacy)

This repository is a legacy project, originally created around **2016** using **Laravel 5.1**. It is preserved here as a testament to my early work and foundational knowledge of full-stack web development. It showcases my understanding of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, database design, and user authentication during that time.

Please note that this project is kept for historical purposes and is not actively maintained.
